Tracing Coronal Loops
=====================

This example traces out the coronal loops in a FITS image
using `~sunkit_image.trace.occult2`.

In this example we will use the settings and the data from Markus Aschwanden's tutorial
on his IDL implementation of the ``OCCULT2`` algorithm, which can be found
`here <http://www.lmsal.com/~aschwand/software/tracing/tracing_tutorial1.html>`__.

The aim of this example is to demonstrate that `~sunkit_image.trace.occult2` provides similar
results compared to the IDL version.

# The maximum number of structures to be examined ``nstruc`` is 1000.
# The number of extra points in the loop below noise level to terminate a loop tracing ``ngap`` is 0.
# The base flux and median flux ratio ``qthresh1`` is 0.0.
# The noise threshold in the image with respect to median flux ``qthresh2`` is 3.0 .
# For the meaning of these parameters please consult the OCCULT2 article.

# Now plot all the detected loops on the original image, we convert the image pixels to
