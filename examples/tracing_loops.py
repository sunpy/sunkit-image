=====================
Coronal Loops Tracing
=====================

This example traces out the coronal loops in a FITS image
using `~sunkit_image.trace.occult2`. In this example we will use the settings
and the data from Markus Aschwanden's tutorial on his IDL implementation of
the ``OCCULT2`` algorithm, which can be found
`here <http://www.lmsal.com/~aschwand/software/tracing/tracing_tutorial1.html>`__.
The aim of this example is to demonstrate that `~sunkit_image.trace.occult2` provides similar
results compared to the IDL version.

# The lowpass filter boxcar filter size ``nsm1`` is taken to be 3.
# The minimum radius of curvature at any point in the loop ``rmin`` is 30 pixels.
# The length of the smallest loop to be detected ``lmin`` is 25 pixels.
# The maximum number of structures to be examined ``nstruc`` is 1000.
# The number of extra points in the loop below noise level to terminate a loop tracing ``ngap`` is 0.
# The base flux and median flux ratio ``qthresh1`` is 0.0.
# The noise threshold in the image with repect to median flux ``qthresh2`` is 3.0 .
# For the meaning of these parameters please consult the OCCULT2 article.
