The following helper functions in `sunkit_image.colaginment` have been removed, with no replacement.
This is because they are designed to be internal helper functions.
If you need to use them in your own code create a copy of the functions from the ``sunkit-image`` source code.

- ``parabolic_turning_point``
- ``calculate_clipping``
- ``check_for_nonfinite_entries``
