The coalignment methods ``calculate_solar_rotate_shift`` and ``mapsequence_coalign_by_rotation`` present in the `sunkit_image.coalignment` have been removed, with no replacement.
Correspondingly the gallery example ``Compensating for Solar Rotation`` making use of these methods are removed.

If you wish to coalign differentially rotated maps, refer to this `example <https://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/generated/gallery/differential_rotation/reprojected_map.html>`__ in sunpy
