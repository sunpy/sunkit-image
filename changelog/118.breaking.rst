Removal of the Automated Swirl Detection Algorithm (ASDA).
This is due to two reasons:
1. This version was no longer supported and outdated.
2. The original code was GPL and we never got the code relicensed and therefore can not be included.

Please use the up to date and supported version: https://github.com/PyDL/ASDA

This includes the following from ``utils``:
* points_in_poly
* reform2d
* remove_duplicate
* calc_gamma
