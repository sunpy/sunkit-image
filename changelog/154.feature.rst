Modifcations to the `sunkit_image.granule` module. 
1. Increase in speed for large images achieved by computing the initial thresholding on a random subset of pixels.
2. Increase in accuracy on images with spatially varying background flux levels achieved by applying a local histogram 
equalization before computing the initial thresholding.
3. Prevention of errors in finding "dim centers" in images that have all-granule edges achieved by adding a "padding" 
of zero pixels around the edges.
5. Correction of the assignment of the values 2 and 3 to brightpoints and dim centers.
