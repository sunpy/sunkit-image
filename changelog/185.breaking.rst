The ``Asda`` and ``Lamb_Oseen`` classes have been removed and replaced with functions that replicate the original process.

The following function were renamed:
- gen_vel -> generate_velocity_field
- gamma_values -> calculate_gamma_values
- vortex_property -> get_vortex_properties

Now to use, the properties that were previously stored within the class should now be passed through the arguments of the methods in case the method used these arguments.
Ex: lo.gen_vel(index[1], index[0]) -> asda.generate_velocity_field(vx, vy, index[1], index[0], r)
