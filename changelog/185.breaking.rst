The ``Asda`` and ``Lamb_Oseen`` classes have been removed and replaced with functions that replicate the original process.

The following function were renamed:
- ``gen_vel`` -> ``generate_velocity_field``
- ``gamma_values`` -> ``calculate_gamma_values``
- ``vortex_property`` -> ``get_vortex_properties``
- ``get_grid`` -> ``get_vortex_meshgrid``
- ``center_edge`` -> ``get_vortex_edges``
- ``get_vtheta`` -> ``get_rotational_velocity``
- ``get_vradial`` -> ``get_radial_velocity``
- ``get_vxvy`` -> ``get_velocity_field``

Now to use, the properties that were previously stored within the class should now be passed through the arguments of the methods in case the method used these arguments.

Example:

``lo.gen_vel(index[1], index[0])`` -> ``asda.generate_velocity_field(vx, vy, index[1], index[0], r)``
