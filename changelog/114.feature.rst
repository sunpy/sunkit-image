Addition of the ``segment`` module and contains functions to segment granulation in images of the solar photosphere.
The key functionality is contained in the `.segment` function, which takes a Map 
and a thresholding method then performs the segmentation, with the segmented Map as output.
Calls to segment look like:
.. code-block:: python
    segmented_data = segment(smap, resolution, skimage_method)
where 
*``smap`` is the Map containing an optical image of the solar photosphere.
*``resolution`` is the spatial resolution of the telescope.
*``skimage_method`` is the base scikit image segmentation technique to use.
*``mark_dim_centers`` is a boolean flag indicating whether the user would like to mark dim intergranule centers for future exploration.
We segment into tri-valued images with 0 = intergranule, 1 = granule, 1.5 = brightpoints, and if marking is desired, dim granule middles marked as 0.5.
