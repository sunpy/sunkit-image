Addition of the sunkit_image/segment.py module. This module cntains functions to segment 
granulation in images of the solar photosphere.

The key functionality is contained in the `segment` function, which takes in a SunPy map 
and a thresholding method and performs the segmentation, with the segmented image output 
as a SunPy map. Calls to segment look like: ::

    segmented_data = segment(smap, resolution, skimage_method)

Where 

*`smap` is a SunPy map containing an optical image of the solar photosphere
*`resolution` is the spatial resolution of the telescope
*`skimage_method` is the base sci-kit image (skimage) segmentation technique to use 
*`mark_dim_centers` is a boleen flag indicating whether the user would like to mark dim 
  intergranule centers for future exploration.

We segment into tri-valued images with 0 = intergranule, 1 = granule, 1.5 = faculae, and 
(if marking is desired) dim granule middles marked as 0.5.
