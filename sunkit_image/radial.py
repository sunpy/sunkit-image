    Returns a SunPy Map with the intensity enhanced above a given radius.

    The enhancement is calculated as follows:

    A summary statistic of the radial dependence of the offlimb emission is calculated.
    Since the UV and EUV emission intensity drops of quickly off the solar limb, it makes sense
    to fit the log of the intensity statistic using some appropriate function.
    The function we use here is a polynomial.
    To calculate the enhancement, the fitted function is normalized to its value at the
    normalization radius from the center of the Sun (a sensible choice is the solar radius).
    The offlimb emission is then divided by this normalized function.

    Fourier Normalizing Radial Gradient Filter approximates the local average and the local standard

    in regions of lower contrast. It takes the input map and divides the region above the application
    radius and in the radial bins into various small angular segments. Then for each of these angular
    segments, the intensity summary and width is calculated. The intensity summary and the width of each
    angular segments are then used to find a Fourier approximation of the intensity summary and width for
    the entire radial bin, this Fourier approximated value is then used to normalize the intensity in the
    radial bin.

    Implementation of the Radial Histogram Equalizing Filter (RHEF).

    The filter works as follows:

    Radial Histogram Equalization is a simple algorithm for removing the radial gradient to reveal
    coronal structure. It also significantly improves the visualization of high dynamic range solar imagery.
    RHE takes the input map and bins the pixels by radius, then ranks the elements in each bin sequentially and normalizes the set to 1.

    .. note::

        The returned maps have their ``plot_settings`` changed to remove the extra normalization step.

    Parameters
    ----------
    smap : `sunpy.map.Map`
        The SunPy map to enhance using the RHEF algorithm.
    radial_bin_edges : `astropy.units.Quantity`, optional
        A two-dimensional array of bin edges of size ``[2, nbins]`` where ``nbins`` is the number of bins.
        These define the radial segments where filtering is applied.
        If None, radial bins will be generated automatically.
    application_radius : `astropy.units.Quantity`, optional
        The radius above which to apply the RHEF. Only regions with radii above this value will be filtered.
        Defaults to 0 solar radii.
    upsilon : float or None, optional
        A double-sided gamma function to apply to modify the equalized histograms. Defaults to 0.35.
    method : ``{"inplace", "numpy", "scipy"}``, optional
        Method used to rank the pixels for equalization.
        Defaults to 'inplace'.
    vignette : `astropy.units.Quantity`, optional
        Radius beyond which pixels will be set to NaN.
        Must be in units that are compatible with "R_sun" as the value will be transformed.
        Defaults to `None`.
    progress : `bool`, optional
        Show a progressbar while computing.
        Defaults to `False`.
    fill : Any, optional
        The value to be placed outside of the bounds of the algorithm.
        Defaults to NaN.

    Returns
    -------
    `sunpy.map.Map`
        A SunPy map with the Radial Histogram Equalizing Filter applied to it.
